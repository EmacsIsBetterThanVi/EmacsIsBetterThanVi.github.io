    <h2 id="about">About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a 10th grader with expirance in programing dating back to 4th grade, when I taught myself Python.</p>
    <p>In the summer between 5th and 6th grade I learned the Java Programing language, and started developing a varaity of programs.</p>
    <p>Then in the summer between 8th and 9th grade I taught myself C++, and started developing my own interpreted language, which I never finished, due to not wanting to have to update every part to version 2.0.</p>
    <p>Finaly in 9th grade I taught myself C, and X86-16 assembly, and started working on my own C compiler, X86 assembler, and OS, which still in a state of incomplete development.</p>

    <p>1. Event-driven programming is based around the concept of events, user inputs, and raised program processes, being bound to a function. <i>The I Have a Dream</i> app used the "On button clicked" event to play the sound.</p>
    <p>2. It is only semi-possible to coreate a app without event based program, since one can technicaly uses a process to await all user input at the begining as part of the INIT function, howerver such a program has limited capability.</p>
    <p>3. The <i>I Have a Dream</i>'s UI is made up of a button element with ta picture of M. L. K. Jr., a label to give instuctions, and a lable to declare who the picture is of.</p>
    <p>4. A cars computer's UI will most likely contain a map, some "Idiot Lights", the speedometer, tachometer, gas gadge, and radio controls. A vending machine UI will most likely contain a remain charge, a selection of options, and a refund button.</p>

    <p>1. 921 is 0b001101010011</p>
    <p>2. My birth day in binary coded as MMDD is 1001100001</p>
    <p>3. The octal number system has 8 digets 0 to 7. This is in accordance with the base-didgets relation of for a given base N, there are N didgets, 0 to N-1. Typicaly if the base exceeds 10 then the extra digets are assigned into the Latin alphabet, then the greek alphabet, the typicaly into assorted characters from the ASCII code points. Hexadecimal(Base 16) has 16 didgets, 0-F.</p>
    <p>4. The next student is assigned id 0b10010100, and the 10th(Base 10) is assigned 0b10011101</p>

    <p>1. A bit is an individual boolean value, stored in a computer, and is the most basic primitive in a computer. 8 bits are combined together to make a byte, which is the basis of computing</p>
    <p>2. Moore's law stats that the transistor count doubles two years, and by extension, processing power does so as well. This however can not be sustained for much longer</p>
    <p>3. The digital explosion is neither good or bad becuase while it makes new sciences, and technolagy posible, and streamlines communication with people further away, it also creates all the vulnerabilities due to the streamlined communication, as well as requiring a rapidly evolving system to keep communications accross the world private.</p>

    <p>1. The main difference between Bill Nye's solar system model and the Second Life model is the medium, with Bill Nye's model being a physical medium, meanwill the Second Life model is in a computer, and is capable of some addional tasks such as simulating orbit</p>
    <p>2. My hypothosis is that if there were a lot more wolves then bunnies then the wolf population would quickly crash after the wolves had eaten most of the bunnies, and soon only the grass will survive. With 10 wolves and 2 rabbits the wolf population crashed, but the rabbits survived, creating a sinusoidal behavior amoung rabbits</p>
    <p>3. Only rabbits, wolves, and grass were included in this simulation because the simulation is focused on the interaction between wolf population and rabbit populations. This introduces bias because it concentrats entierly on one aspect of the behaviors of the population.</p>
    <p>4. One benefit of a city fire department using simulations is that this system allows them to test multiple conditions, free of danger, however a simulation can only test the scenearios that the designer can think off.</p>
    <p>5. A model I use in my everyday life is ETAs of trains, which are calculated based entirely on past times, and locations. This captures the details of common issues such as other trains being late, or ongoing track matenence, but does not account for uncommon problomes.</p>
