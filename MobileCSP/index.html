    <h2 id="about">About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a 10th grader with expirance in programing dating back to 4th grade, when I taught myself Python.</p>
    <p>In the summer between 5th and 6th grade I learned the Java Programing language, and started developing a varaity of programs.</p>
    <p>Then in the summer between 8th and 9th grade I taught myself C++, and started developing my own interpreted language, which I never finished, due to not wanting to have to update every part to version 2.0.</p>
    <p>Finaly in 9th grade I taught myself C, and X86-16 assembly, and started working on my own C compiler, X86 assembler, and OS, which still in a state of incomplete development.</p>

    <p>921 is 0b001101010011</p>
    <p>My birth day in binary coded as MMDD is 1001100001</p>
    <p>The octal number system has 8 digets 0 to 7. This is in accordance with the base-didgets relation of for a given base N, there are N didgets, 0 to N-1. Typicaly if the base exceeds 10 then the extra digets are assigned into the Latin alphabet, then the greek alphabet, the typicaly into assorted characters from the ASCII code points. Hexadecimal(Base 16) has 16 didgets, 0-F.</p>
    <p>The next student is assigned id 0b10010100, and the 10th(Base 10) is assigned 0b10011101</p>
    <h3 id="Q_2.11">2.11</h3>
    <p>A bit is an individual boolean value, stored in a computer, and is the most basic primitive in a computer. 8 bits are combined together to make a byte, which is the basis of computing</p>
    <p>Moore's law stats that the transistor count doubles two years, and by extension, processing power does so as well. This however can not be sustained for much longer</p>
    <p>The digital explosion is neither good or bad becuase while it makes new sciences, and technolagy posible, and streamlines communication with people further away, it also creates all the vulnerabilities due to the streamlined communication, as well as requiring a rapidly evolving system to keep communications accross the world private.</p>
