    <h2 id="about">About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a 10th grader with expirance in programing dating back to 4th grade, when I taught myself Python.</p>
    <p>In the summer between 5th and 6th grade I learned the Java Programing language, and started developing a varaity of programs.</p>
    <p>Then in the summer between 8th and 9th grade I taught myself C++, and started developing my own interpreted language, which I never finished, due to not wanting to have to update every part to version 2.0.</p>
    <p>Finaly in 9th grade I taught myself C, and X86-16 assembly, and started working on my own C compiler, X86 assembler, and OS, which still in a state of incomplete development.</p>
