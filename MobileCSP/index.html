    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 10th grader with expirance in programing dating back to 4th grade, when I taught myself Python.</p>
    <p>In the summer between 5th and 6th grade I learned the Java Programing language, and started developing a varaity of programs.</p>
    <p>Then in the summer between 8th and 9th grade I taught myself C++, and started developing my own interpreted language, which I never finished, due to not wanting to have to update every part to version 2.0.</p>
    <p>Finaly in 9th grade I taught myself C, and X86-16 assembly, and started working on my own C compiler, X86 assembler, and OS, which still in a state of incomplete development.</p>

    <p>1. Event-driven programming is based around the concept of events, user inputs, and raised program processes, being bound to a function. <i>The I Have a Dream</i> app used the "On button clicked" event to play the sound.</p>
    <p>2. It is only semi-possible to coreate a app without event based program, since one can technicaly uses a process to await all user input at the begining as part of the INIT function, howerver such a program has limited capability.</p>
    <p>3. The <i>I Have a Dream</i>'s UI is made up of a button element with ta picture of M. L. K. Jr., a label to give instuctions, and a lable to declare who the picture is of.</p>
    <p>4. A cars computer's UI will most likely contain a map, some "Idiot Lights", the speedometer, tachometer, gas gadge, and radio controls. A vending machine UI will most likely contain a remain charge, a selection of options, and a refund button.</p>

    <p>1. I feel least confident describing the OCR(Optical Character Recognition) since I struggle to comprehend how those read the image. The hardware component I feel least confident describing is probobly the FPU(Floating-point Processing Unit)</p>
    <p>2. An example of a special purpose computer I am familiar with is a basic calculator, a computer designed simply to recive and perform mathamatical operations</p>
    <p>3. The "Connecting to the Companion" execution system is based on the language Lisp, which is transmited over the internet, and then interpreted; on the other hand Packaging the app compiles the blocks into Java, which is then compiled into Java Byte Codes, which are either compiled or interpreted on the machine. The Java Byte Codes run at a much faster rate than genaric interpretion, even if interpreted.</p>
    <p>4. It would take about 7 Megabyte(7*10^6 bytes) to store all the Harry Potter novels. This means that you could store a thousend copies of every Hary Potter novel is a 7Gb flash drive.</p>

    <p>1.  An abstraction is a reduced complexity object(I use object as a general term to mean a physical, virtual, or conceptual noun or to mean the concept of performing an action), that is, an object which has been striped of it's details, down to a simpler object</p>
    <p>2. Some examples of abstractions include the word abstraction, since it is not writing out the full definition, and any programing langugage, since a programing langugage is not the direct machine code as binary, but rather a easier to read and write, human language adjesant collection of text, which the computer will de abstracte and run. In fact the machine code is still an abstraction since it is just a number, rather than a compleate logic table of every posible input, and it's associated output</p>
    <p>3. An assembely language and the accociated assembler is a great example of an abstraction, since assembely is a collection of strings(text) which will be assembled into the machine code, which is closer to how the machine functions than the strings are, however the machine code is still an abstraction, as I stated in my previous answer.</p>

    <p>3. The octal number system has 8 digets 0 to 7. This is in accordance with the base-didgets relation of for a given base N, there are N didgets, 0 to N-1. Typicaly if the base exceeds 10 then the extra digets are assigned into the Latin alphabet, then the greek alphabet, the typicaly into assorted characters from the ASCII code points. Hexadecimal(Base 16) has 16 didgets, 0-F.</p>

    <p>2. The OR symbol is extremly abstract, to the point were any of "or", "OR", or "||" can be considered meaning the same exact thing, none of which given any detail on what or does, meanwhile the physical circuit does not say what it does, but can only be represented in one way, meaning that an or gate is inherently an or gate, and is not controled by the constructs of language, making it less abstract. The logic table of an or gate tells us exactly how it works, giving us every detail, making it the least abstract of this collection of objects.</p>
    <p>3. The binary didget 0 or 1 does not tell us how anything works, it being just a value, and is therefor quite abstract, on the other hand the physical circuit of a flip flop is does not even tell us the value and is even more abstract. Finaly the diagram is a demonstration on how the flipflop works, and is the least abstract of these.</p>

    <p>1. A bit is an individual boolean value, stored in a computer, and is the most basic primitive in a computer. 8 bits are combined together to make a byte, which is the basis of computing</p>
    <p>2. Moore's law stats that the transistor count doubles two years, and by extension, processing power does so as well. This however can not be sustained for much longer</p>
    <p>3. The digital explosion is neither good or bad becuase while it makes new sciences, and technolagy posible, and streamlines communication with people further away, it also creates all the vulnerabilities due to the streamlined communication, as well as requiring a rapidly evolving system to keep communications accross the world private.</p>

    <p>1. The main difference between Bill Nye's solar system model and the Second Life model is the medium, with Bill Nye's model being a physical medium, meanwill the Second Life model is in a computer, and is capable of some addional tasks such as simulating orbit</p>
    <p>2. My hypothosis is that if there were a lot more wolves then bunnies then the wolf population would quickly crash after the wolves had eaten most of the bunnies, and soon only the grass will survive. With 10 wolves and 2 rabbits the wolf population crashed, but the rabbits survived, creating a sinusoidal behavior amoung rabbits</p>
    <p>3. Only rabbits, wolves, and grass were included in this simulation because the simulation is focused on the interaction between wolf population and rabbit populations. This introduces bias because it concentrats entierly on one aspect of the behaviors of the population.</p>
    <p>4. One benefit of a city fire department using simulations is that this system allows them to test multiple conditions, free of danger, however a simulation can only test the scenearios that the designer can think off.</p>
    <p>5. A model I use in my everyday life is ETAs of trains, which are calculated based entirely on past times, and locations. This captures the details of common issues such as other trains being late, or ongoing track matenence, but does not account for uncommon problomes.</p>
    <h3 id="Q_4.10">4.10</h3>
    <p>1. In the final version of the map tour app collected an ineger location and and a name for the location, which is requested by the user, and is one hundread percent optional.</p>
    <p>2. Social media apps have fully removed our privacy, since everything said is public, and is collected whether we like it or not.</p>
    <p>3. It is posible to indetify a person within a reasonable selection based on gender and date of birth, which a zip code is usualy sufficent to narrow this down to a workable number.</p>
    <p>4. GPS navigation collects location and destination to generate a path. This data is sent to the servers which uses trafic data to calculate the shortest posible root. If this data was stored, or obtained by a person trying to locate a person would have no trouble finding the current location, or their destination, with paterns they could determin their life style, which is more information than most people what others to know about them.</p>
    <p>5. The privace act is not very effective since the government in response to 9/11 created an agency which is not effected by the Privacy Act. Also many other operarations bypased it through private companies</p>
    <p>6. I don't particularly care about privacy, if I was given the option I would probobly not give the companies by information, but since I am not really given that choice, I will wilingly accept my lack of privacy.</p>
    <p>7. Any and all interactions we make with any form of public computer system, and some private computer systems, leave a log of our usage start, and end times, when some events ocure, and where we were. It is quite important for people to know this, to know what is known about them, and who knows what regarding their information.</p>

    <p>2. The forward() procedure is limited to a API programer defined distance, while the forward(distance) now uses the distance defined by the API user, and as such allows for more variation.</p>
    <p>3. The turn() procedure is limited to a API programer defined angle, typicaly 90 degrees. This abstraction of adding turn(angle) solves the probolam of angles that do not have φ mod 90 = 0, allowing arbitrary rotations within the API.

    <p>4. The best solotion to finding the Ace of Spades in an unordered deck would be to scan through the entire deck(Some search algarithms might make use of multiple proceses to search from multiple ends of the list or deck by dividing the deck into multiple equal pieces, which it runs a linar search algarithm from the center and ends for a 4 process search algarithm(This completes the process in at most 1/4 of the total cycles of a single process search))</p>
    <p>5. An example of a search I do on a regular basisis is land searching, a liniar search through a deck of magic cards, which can contain multiple instances of the same target.

    <p>2. My app includes a procedure called "UpdateSpeachToText" which updates the SpeachRecognizer stops the Speach to Text if it has been started by this procedure. If Speach to Text has not been started by this procedure and the NoStart argument has not been set then it will set the SpeachRecognizer's language, and start speach to text. The procedure also sets the start button to the correct image, which it uses to determine if speach to text has been started.</p>
    <p>3a. The translation part, and the Text To Speech system works, however the Speech To Text errors out with the code "unrecognized method: Irritants: (SetLanguage)", so at least one part is non-functional, also for some reason it will not speack chinese, however that could be a system difference<br>3b. </p>
    <p>4. My code is almost fully refactored, with only one set of repeated identical blocks, which are simple asignment operaters of "SPEAK ← true (Set global SPEAK to true)", and as such it would make very little sense to surround them in a function.</p>

    <h3 id="C1.4">4. Practice Exam Questions</h3>
    <h4 id="C1.4.1">1. Program Design, function and purpose</h4>
    <p>a. This program translates one language to another, and demonstrates the pronucation of the language, with the ability to say a sentance for it to translate, which it hopefuly autodetects the language</p>
    <p>b. The program functions by sending data to the translation API provided by MIT App Inventor, then sending the responce to the MIT App Inventor Text To Speach System. The spoken input is handled by requesting data from the Speach to Text System built into MIT App Inventor.</p>
    <p>c. The inputs of the programs are a text box which can be typed into, or a speech to text system, which can be started by pressing a button. The outputs of the programs are in a text box, and audiable speech of the contents of the text box.</p>
    <p>d. The users of my app is people who do not speak the same language as another person that they are talking with, which they would use this app to get translations, and theoreticaly use it as a second person who speaks both languages saying their sentance in their language, which it then anounces the translation in the other language.</p>
    <h4 id="C1.4.2">2. Algorithm Development</h4>
    <p>The UpdateSpeachToText function uses an if statement to branch into two seperate parts based on whether or not the start button is using the second image or the argument NoStart was set to true, performing a reset procedure on the SpeachToText System by updating the translation, in spoken mode, stoping the SpeachToText, and updating the image in the button to the Microphone Inactive state. If the boolean expresion evaluates to false then it starts the SpeachToText system, and updates the image to the Microphone Active state.</p>
    <h4 id="C1.4.3">3. Erros and Testing</h4>
    <p>a. My Procedure should generate spoken output, update the image on the SpeachToText button, and update the text in the result textbox</p>
    <p>b. For some unknown reason sometimes the spoken output is skipped, notably when the target language contains charcters that the system language does not understand, also during an earlier version of the procedure it would fail to run, displaying the error "unrecognized method: Irritants: (SetLanguage)", which was fixed by removing a block which is not in this version of the function. The spoken output skipping could probobly be fixed by setting the speech language, however I was not aware of this field when I wrote the app.</p>
    <h4 id="C1.4.4">4. Data and Procedural Abstraction</h4>
    <p>a. The procedure idetified in part <a onclick='sth("C1.3_A");' href="javascript:void(0)">3A Procedure</a> updates much of the app, such as starting/stoping speach to text, calling for translation in spoken mode, and updating the speech to text request button. This is nessissary for much of the functionality of the app.</p>
    <p>The procedual abstraction remove all need for the usage the same segement of code, beyond a simple function call, more than once, while the data abstraction is mostly to carry values into events and procedures as arguments, with one variable used to cary a value into an event which does not support the required argument.</p>
